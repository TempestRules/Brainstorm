# Password manager

This is a simple password manager project. It is mostly simple because of the encryption algorithm, which is not very secure. The database is run with docker and instructions for running it are in the Dockerfile.

After the database is started, run manager.py

- The purpose was for me to get more familiar with Python and reacquainted with SQL.

- No GUI, works with terminal.

- The user can give their email or a site/application and receive their login information.

- Should be updated with the ability to update stored passwords and a better encryption algorithm.
