# WebElm

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.0.2.

The purpose of the project was for me to get more familiar with Angular and web development.

It's basically a mix of different techniques i learnt in previous course.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
